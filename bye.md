# Bye, bye, Mr. GeminiCord guy
Geminicord is being retired! In it's place, we're developing a new project called **Iris**! It basically has the same function, but has more features, less buggy, actually not stupid, diffrent models, and much much more. Basically, GeminiCord is terrible. I started out the project as a person who wanted to code who didn't know how well, and used chatgpt early on.. And then when I came back to the project, it was very difficult to go through this terrible code and it still is. So, it's best to start from scratch. GeminiCord will still be up for people to mess around with when Iris is in development, but once Iris is at least done enough to use, GeminiCord will be shut down and no more updates will be published. Sorry if this is bad news for some, but TBH, get over it. We're creating a new one.
